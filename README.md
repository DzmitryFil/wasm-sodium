# wasm32-unknown-unknown and sodiumoxide

A proof-of-concept repository showing how libsodium and the sodiumoxide bindings
can be used in the browser with the wasm32-unknown-unknown target.

To test this out you'll need:

* A Linux machine
* The `docker` command
* A nightly Rust compiler (`rustup update nightly`)
* The wasm32 target (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`)
* The `wasm-bindgen` CLI command (`cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli`)
* Node.js with wasm support

And with all that in place you can execute the example with:

```
./build.sh
```

And you should see something like:

```
...
+ node run.js
10 randomly generated bytes are [132, 50, 0, 212, 16, 153, 236, 63, 8, 107]
sha256("Hello, World!") = dffd6021bb2bd5b0af676290809ec3a53191dd81c7f70a4b28688a362182986f
```
